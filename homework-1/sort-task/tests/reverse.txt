Then the loud sound did seem to fade
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll, lotta soul, he said
Lo, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, lo, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, lo, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, lo, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
LA, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
I leaned back on my radio
Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
