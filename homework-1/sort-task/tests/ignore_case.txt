Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
Goodbye love
Hey my love
I leaned back on my radio
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
LA, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
La, la, la, la-la, lo, la, la
La, la, lo, la-la, la, la, la
La, lo, la, la-la, la, la, la
Lo, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll, lotta soul, he said
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
