Goodbye love
I leaned back on my radio
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, lo, la, la-la, la, la, la
Lo, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
LA, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, lo
La, la, la, la-la, lo, la, la
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
La, la, lo, la-la, la, la, la
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Hey my love
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll, lotta soul, he said
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
